** Topic **  : social-ecommerce management system. Aim : To develop a data model and social-commerce management system.

** Objective **  :
                  Social ecommerce is an extension of e-commerce that involves social media and online media. User-generated 
                  content and sharing reviews also come under this category. Social commerce was first introduced with the concept
                  of promoting e-commerce brands on other websites through advertorial content. Here , user reviews and peer to
                  peer conversation in social media determine the shopping of a brand. This can happen without the brand being active
                  in the social commerce front and can indicate the influence social media has on both online and Offline .
                  
                  
*** The problem with the e-commerce system *** : 

                                                The e-commerce system has various flaws because most of the people donâ€™t use the system even 
                                                though it has several advantages over traditional stores. The biggest problem is that it takes 
                                                at least a day to deliver a product to the customer. While some other issues are a duplication 
                                                of the product means the product is shown on the web some time differs with the original product
                                                due to which next time that customer goes to buy the product through the traditional type of stores.
                                                
 *** Proposed system  *** :
                            Social ecommerce is the buying and selling of goods or
                            services directly within a social media platform. This model moves social
                            media beyond its traditional role in the discovery process by encouraging
                            users to complete the entire purchase process without leaving their preferred apps.
